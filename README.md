# ASCII Donut Animation

A C++ terminal application that generates a customizable 3D spinning donut animation. Users can interactively adjust the size and color of the donut through simple console inputs, creating a visually engaging ASCII art display. This project is an excellent demonstration of the use of mathematical models for ASCII art animation and ANSI escape codes for color management in the terminal.

## Features
- Interactive size and color customization for the ASCII donut
- Continuous 3D spinning animation effect
- Cross-platform compatibility for terminals supporting ANSI escape codes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Terminal or command prompt that supports ANSI escape codes for color output

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/ASCII-Donut-Animation.git
  cd ASCII-Donut-Animation
  cd src
  ```

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
  ```bash
  g++ -o donut src/circle.cpp -lm
```

3. Run the compiled application:
   ```bash
    ./donut
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize the size and color of your ASCII donut.
